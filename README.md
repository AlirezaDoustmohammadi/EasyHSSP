# EasyHSSP
A web-based tool for analyzing and visualizing HSSP files

</br></br>
Tremendous development of protein, peptides, and nucleotides sequencing tools leads to high
volume of protein sequencing stored in data bases like Uniprot and NCBI. High volume of protein
sequencing provides the opportunity of implementing different algorithms in the data to suit our
needs; in this regard DSSP algorithm is one of the many algorithms and it delivers DSSP and <b>HSSP</b>
files.
